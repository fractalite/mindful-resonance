# Audio Files Required

Please add the following audio files to this directory:

## Ambient Music Tracks (MP3 format, max 5MB each)
- cosmic-flow.mp3 - Gentle ambient music with soft pads and subtle movement
- deep-ocean.mp3 - Deep underwater ambience with gentle waves
- forest-night.mp3 - Nighttime forest sounds with soft wind and crickets

Each track should be:
- High quality (at least 192kbps)
- 5-10 minutes long (they will loop seamlessly)
- Properly normalized (peak around -3dB)
- Tested for seamless looping

Note: The binaural beats are generated programmatically using Web Audio API's OscillatorNode, so no audio files are needed for those.
